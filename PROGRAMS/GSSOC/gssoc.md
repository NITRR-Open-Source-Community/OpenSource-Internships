## Introduction
`Girl Script Summer of Code` (GSSoC) is an annual open-source program organized by the Girl Script Foundation with the aim of encouraging women and non-binary individuals to participate in open-source projects. This case study provides an overview of GSSoC and highlights its impact on the open-source community.

## Background
GSSoC was first launched in 2018, with the vision of empowering underrepresented genders in technology by providing them with an opportunity to work on real-world open-source projects. The program is open to participants from around the world, regardless of their educational background or prior experience in coding.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of GSSoC include:
- Encouraging more women and non-binary individuals to enter the field of open source development.
- Bridging the gender gap in the tech industry by providing mentorship and resources.
- Enhancing the skills and confidence of participants through practical project work.
- Contributing to open-source projects with meaningful code and documentation.

## Implementation
- **Participant Selection**
GSSoC starts with a rigorous selection process where participants are chosen based on their coding skills, previous contributions to open source, and their project preferences.

- **Project Assignments**
Once selected, participants are assigned to various open-source projects. These projects span a wide range of domains, from web development to machine learning and more.

- **Mentorship**
Each participant is paired with an experienced mentor who guides them throughout the program. Mentors provide technical support, code reviews, and valuable insights into open-source development.

- **Collaboration**
Participants collaborate with their peers and the open-source community. They work on solving real-world issues, adding new features, and improving project documentation.

## Results
GSSoC has achieved remarkable results over the years:
- Thousands of women and non-binary individuals have participated, leading to increased diversity in open-source communities.
- Numerous open-source projects have benefited from the contributions made by GSSoC participants.
- Many participants have gone on to pursue successful careers in technology and open-source development.

## Conclusion
Girl Script Summer of Code is a groundbreaking initiative that has made significant strides in promoting diversity in open source. It empowers women and non-binary individuals to excel in technology while making valuable contributions to the global open-source ecosystem.
